# A Crowd Sourced YouTube Comments Spam Filter
## Various lists of known scam domains and fake scam accounts on Whatsapp, Instagram, Telegram, etc.

### Current Lists:
- **Spam Domains**: Domains used in scam YouTube comments
- **Spam Accounts**: External social media accounts (instagram, telegram, etc) that are mentioned in scam comments as the point of contact for that particular scam. Usually these are scams advertising fake hacking services, free vbucks/robux, etc.
- **Spam Threads**: Accounts and Aliases (fake names of people) mentioned as the point of contact specifically in coordinated spam threads, where multiple spam bots pretend to have a conversation and end up 'recommending' the fake services of someone on another platform (usually an 'expert investor', and often involving crypto)

#### For more detailed explanations of each, refer to the [Wiki Here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Domains-List/wiki), or view some quick examples below

### How to Contribute:
- You can submit an **issue** with new spam domains or accounts, but they MUST contain a direct link to a spam comment as proof, or a video on which many obvious spam comments are promoting the domain.
- Remember: A zero false positive rate must be the highest priority
- Please refrain from submitting pull requests, and instead just use issues as submissions. This will make it easier for me to manage the version/date and merge conflicts
- Please read about the categories [in the Wiki](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Domains-List/wiki) before submitting
